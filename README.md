# GEO4322-The Surface Energy Balance in Cold Environments 

Repository for prject presentation and code in GEO4432.

- Task: Write about subsurface runoff in proportion to saturation. Investigate how differnt depths of the "bucket" (1=forest, 0.1=close to only bedrock) affects the suface and subsurface runoff. 

- Angle: Investigate the so called "The Rational Method" mentioned in http://drdbthompson.net/writings/rational.pdf and on page 514 in the book for calculation of design discharge of a small watershed. This model could be runned for differnt surfaces (Table page 519) as an addition to incestigating the influece of the bucket depth.  

- Information from these could also provide usefull:
